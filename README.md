# OpenSchema Virtualization Specification

![img/hexagon_square_small.png](img/hexagon_square_small.png)

This is the virtualization development specification repository, generated from the 
template for the [openschemas/schema-builder](https://www.github.com/openschemas/schema-builder)
to generate a schema.org specification using [map2model](https://www.github.com/openschemas/map2model).

 - [Virtualization](specifications/Virtualization)

For complete generation and usage, see the [openschemas/spec-template](https://www.github.com/openschemas/spec-template).

## Resources

 - the [configuration.yml](specifications/configuration.yml) defines adding Virtualization to the list to be generated
 - the documents for (easy update) of fields live in [Google Sheets](). To contribute, please ask @vsoch to share with you!  When you are done, **export each sheet** as a tsv file (tab separated value) and drop into the [Hardware](specifications/Hardware) subfolder.

Then open a pull request and upon merge, the Github pages will be updated with your specification.
